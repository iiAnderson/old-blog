# Welcome

Hello! Over the last few months I have been designing a system to ingest data from National Rail's Push Port feeds. These feeds contain data relating to all trains running across Network Rail track in the UK. I hope this dataset will allow fellow train and data enthusiasts to explore the weird and wonderful world of rail in the UK - along with holding higher powers accountable for how they run the railway!
